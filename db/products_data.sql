Plastic model kit. Manufacturers Description: William Stanier (1876-1965) was headhunted from the GWR to become Chief Mechanical Engineer of London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railways in 1932. With the support of the Chairman, Sir Josiah Stamp, Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger, modern and more powerful array of designs. Soon after his appointment, Stanier also focused on refurbishing and standardising the Coach stock of the LMS and developed the Period III LMS coaches which later became known as Stanier Coaches. These designs were extremely popular and successful and many were still in service in the mid 1960s. There are many examples of Period III coaches operating on Heritage Railways throughout the UK today. The Dapol OO Model of the Stanier Coach is derived from refurbished Airfix/Mainline tooling originally purchased by Dapol in the 1980s. There are some compromises on detail accuracy due to the condition and usability of the 40+ year old tooling. However, we feel the model captures the essence of the Period III coach design well and offers an extremely affordable way of building up a fleet of pre or post nationalised fleet of LMS coaches.

It was employed on long-distance express trains on the LNER and its successors, British Railways Eastern and North-Eastern Regions, notably on the 10am London to Edinburgh Flying Scotsman service after which it was named. In its career 4472 Flying Scotsman has covered more than 2,000,000 miles (3,200,000 km).Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue. Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges. With this in mind it is easy to see that those models that make up the Hornby RailRoad range are a simple and cost effective way of adding to a train set providing a suitable and most appropriate stepping stone into the varied and fascinating World of model railways.The introductory range offers not only a selection of individual locomotives, rolling stock and accessories but an assortment of train and wagon packs ideally suited for either train set rolling stock enhancements or for those who wish to experiment and try their hands at developing their modelling techniques!This DCC Ready locomotive is compatible with analogue train layouts, but can easily be converted for use on a DCC (digital) layout. This loco is ''DCC Ready'', meaning they feature a special socket ready to receive a DCC Decoder. To convert this locomotive for use on a DCC layout one of the following digital decoder chips are required; R8245 Sapphire Decoder or R8249 V1 3 NMRA Loco Decoder. Once this decoder is fitted it is ready to use on a DCC layout. Box Contains 1 x locomotive');

It was the smallest of the ''Big Four'' railway regions with most of it''s revenue coming from passenger traffic rather than freight in the more densely populated region of southern England. A number of famous ''named'' trains were operated by SR including the Brighton Belle, Bournemouth Belle, Golden Arrow, the Night Ferry (London - Paris and Brussels), Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle. Both Richard Maunsell and Oliver Bulleid served as Chief Mechanical Engineers to the SR between 1923 and 1948 and both designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace those inherited in 1923. The electrification of the region began in 1929 under the management of Sir Herbert Walker. On completion it was the world''s largest electrified railway system. Southern Railway gave the designation 2-BIL to the DC third rail electric multiple units built during the 1930s. The formation was a 2-car set: MBTL-DTCL, and were called 2-BIL (2-car Bi-Lavatory stock) because each set had two lavatories, one in each car. They were built to work long distance semi-fast services on the newly electrified lines from London to Eastbourne, Portsmouth and Reading. Between 1935 and 1938, a total of 152 sets of the Class 2-BIL were built in 4 batches and were numbered 2001-2152. Numbers 2001-2010 in 1935 for service on the London to Eastbourne sector. Numbers 2011-2048 in 1936 for the London Waterloo to Alton and Portsmouth slow service.
